# Email to PI when unsure of status

## When PI is not found on their university website

Subject: Regarding your Databrary authorization request

Dear Dr. [Last Name],

Thank you for registering on Databrary. "Authorized investigator” status requires that the researcher be a professor (or similar) at a college or university. Alternatively, researchers who work under the supervision of a professor (students, postdocs, staff) can be authorized as an “affiliate” by an authorized professor at their university. I am unable to locate your profile online to determine whether you are eligible for investigator status. Please, can you send me the link to your profile page on your university’s website? Or if you will need to become authorized as an affiliate, please ask your supervising professor to apply for authorization.

Kind regards,  
Andrea

## When PI appears to be student

Subject: Regarding your Databrary authorization request

Dear [Mr./Ms. Last Name],

Thank you for registering on Databrary. "Authorized investigator” status requires that the researcher be a professor (or similar) at a college or university. Alternatively, researchers who work under the supervision of a professor (students, postdocs, staff) can be authorized as an “affiliate” by an authorized professor at their university. According to my online search for your profile, you are a student at **[Institution Name]**. So, to have access to the shared data on Databrary, you would need your supervising professor to become authorized.

Please read this information about affiliate status https://databrary.org/access.html.

My apologies if I have misrepresented your position at **[Institution Name]** and you are eligible to become authorized as an investigator. Please update me with the appropriate profile.

Dear Dr. [Last Name],

Thank you for registering on Databrary. We've received your request for authorization and need to send your Access Agreement to your university for their approval. If you agree, we would be happy to send your agreement on your behalf to make the process simple for you.

#From Karen to PI asking them to start collecting participant permissions to share after getting authorized

Dear [Researcher],

About Databrary:
Great news that you have received your signed agreement and will be authorized soon on Databrary. You will have access to all the shared data on Databrary.

Would you consider asking parents in your study for permission to share their videos so that you'd have the option to share the data in the future? Here is our Databrary User Guide that outlines the different ways you can obtain releases for sharing. We have provided template language, release forms, and video examples that can help you get started. To amend your protocol to request permission for sharing, you will likely need to talk with your IRB. We can help with that if you like.

This may also be helpful because you might need to upload your videos to Databrary to get the transcoded copy to use in Datavyu anyway. If the data are up on Databrary, adding permissions would not be difficult and the Databrary team would be happy to help you.

​I’ve cc’ed **Vicky (Datavyu tech support), Drew (can help with uploading your already collected data), and Lisa (can help with permissions).**
Please let us know how we can help.

​Many thanks,


# Other cases & examples for reference

# OSP PERSON APPLIES FOR AUTHORIZATION

Dear [Researcher],

Thank you for registering for Databrary. I see that you submitted an authorization request for Miami University and before I move forward with your authorization, I just need a little bit of information.

I see that you are the Associate Director of OARS. Authorized users on Databrary are typically individuals at the faculty level that conduct research at their institution. To gain access to Databrary data, one has to be approved for authorization. You applied to be an Authorized Investigator through Miami University which means that Miami University will verify that you have PI status and are able to conduct independent research. If so, Miami University may agree to take responsibility for your use of Databrary data.

I am happy to help you process your authorization through your institution and submit your access agreement (attached here) for approval through Miami University. Please let me know how you would like me to move forward or if you would like any other information about Databrary and the authorization process.

Best,
Lisa


## PI person listing dean

Dear Donna,

Thank you for submitting your authorization request. I’d be glad to work on your authorization through Niagara University. The person that signs the agreement is not usually a Dean, but is someone at the institutional level that is authorized to sign on behalf of the institution, typically in the Sponsored Programs office. This is because your university not only verifies that you are an independent research that has an IRB/REB that oversees your work, but they also vouch for you and take responsibility for your use of Databrary. In all the contexts we’ve come across, this is someone at the university level.

Upon a quick search of NU’s website I found that the SPFR office is probably the right place to start http://www.niagara.edu/sponsored-programs-and-foundation-relations-staff/. Is it ok with you if I submit your Databrary Access Agreement to Adrienne Stanfill and/or Jill Shuey?

Many thanks,
Lisa

## Postdoc wanting authorization, but needing PI to obtain authorization first

Patricia can ‘authorize’ you as her affiliate, but her authorization to access Databrary data is not final or effective until an authorized official at the University of Toronto signs off on her Databrary Access Agreement to verify that she is eligible to be an authorized investigator and to take responsibility for her use of Databrary data.

The person that would sign Patricia’s agreement is usually from your university’s research administration or grants & contracts office and is usually the same office or person that signs off on funding proposals or other agreements. Do you know who that person might be? Knowing the best person to contact will help me expedite the process.

There is more information about this in our user guide: http://databrary.org/access/guide/investigators.html. Please let me know if you have any other questions.

Many thanks,

# Lauren adamson - GSU delay

Dear  Lauren,

It was great to meet you at SRCD. While I figure out how to solve the delay on Roger’s authorization, I’d like to get yours moving. You’ll need to have an official at GSU sign your agreement and vouch for you in order to complete your authorization. This doesn’t obligate you to anything, and does not require IRB approval, it only allows you to have access to shared data in Databrary and to be able to share data, once you have consent from participants and are ready to do so.

May I email the Director of GSU’s OSPA office, Ken Packman, on your behalf? Do you have another contact in that office that might be helpful to include?

Once they approve the first agreement, it’s always easier to authorize additional faculty at the same university. Please let me know if you have any questions.

Many thanks,
Lisa

# Concerns about getting authorized

cc/Karen Adolph, Rick Gilmore, Ahmad Arshad

Dear [PI Name],

Thank you for letting us know your plans and your concerns about getting authorized through [Institution]. Your comments are really useful for helping us to communicate more effectively with researchers.

Databrary has a unique institutional agreement that allows authorized researchers access to shared data on the library regardless of whether the researchers have plans for reusing a dataset for research or have no immediate plans for reusing datasets. With video, researchers really need to “see what’s there” before they can decide whether a dataset is appropriate for reuse. (Perhaps the context really isn’t quite right, or the essential body parts are not visible, or the speech cannot be deciphered.) Moreover, many users want to see shared videos so that they can learn about a procedure or a coding rule, and they have no immediate plans to reuse the videos for research. And most users want to use shared excerpts for teaching and educational purposes.

The PIs would be happy to have a Skype meeting with you to show you around the site and give you a better flavor of the sort of shared data currently available to authorized users.

??Also, your colleague at Utah could get authorized through her university and give you access as her affiliate prior to your own authorization through NIH. [SHOULD WE TELL FOLK THAT THIS ROUTE IS POSSIBLE??]??

Please let us know if we can be of further assistance to you.

Best wishes,
Andrea


# IRB APPROVAL NOT NECESSARY

Sometimes these offices send the Access Agreement as a reference to the IRB office, but IRB approval or review is not required for authorization to access the library, only the institutional official needs to approve and sign-off on it. We’ve learned that submitting this to the IRB directly usually causes some confusion and sometimes delays the approval. The IRB does need to approve any protocol changes that include databrary sharing language, as well as any new research that is conducted using Databrary data, but those terms are included in our Access Agreement.

# WHY DO I HAVE TO GO THROUGH ALL THIS LEGAL ACTION TO GET DATABRARY DATA?

Dear Dr. Best,

We understand that this may seem like a bit of a legal hurdle, but we follow this procedure for the safety of our researchers, their participants, and the data. Databrary is a web-based library for open sharing of video data, images, and metadata among authorized researchers. Since videos and images are inherently identifiable, access to shared data is limited to researchers who have been authorized by their institution.

Authorized researchers are granted both user and contributor privileges to all of Databrary. Researchers become authorized by having their university vouch for them and co-sign their Access Agreement, which lays out the rights and responsibilities of the researcher, the institution, and Databrary. The agreement needs to be signed by an institutional official with the authority to bind the institution--they are taking responsibility for your use of all Databrary resources.

We’ve had very good results with over fifty universities and we hope to authorize you through Wake Forest University so you can take advantage of the large number of privileges that come with accessing all of Databrary. I will submit your agreement shortly.

Many thanks,
Vicky

# WHERE IS MY ACCESS AGREEMENT?

Hey v- Just a thought on this… She never actually submitted a request right? I thought she was saying she didn’t know what to do now (because Wake Forest isn’t created on Databrary yet and she couldn’t find our agreement online—or in her freaking email link). Maybe a more tailored answer that first specifically answered her questions (something like “you electronically signed your agreement when you registered, and we would be happy to help you get it signed by the correct official at your university.”) and then use bits or large parts of our template emails where it makes sense. I know you reworked it a bit, and your intuition was perfect to just go straight for figuring out Wake Forest’s signer, so it’s not a problem at all.

#CAN I RUN DATABRARY ON MY OWN SERVER

Hi Tommy,

All our source code is GPL licensed and available at https://github.com/databrary/databrary.

Running a stand-alone instance is theoretically possible, and we have done so ourselves, however it's not something we currently support officially.  It will take a dedicated server and a good amount of setup.  Also, there is a significant amount of "databrary.org"-specific content that you would probably want to change to run on a local domain.

Lisa

# FOLLOWING UP ON AN AUTHORIZATION

Dear Dr.[Last Name],


have you heard anything or is there anything I can do to help? would you like me to follow up with (your osp person)

# IRB/DATA USE AGREEMENT

Hi Jean,

The IRB stipulation has not caused delays with approving the Databrary Access Agreement at other institutions. We designed the access agreement to be different than the standard DUA model that typically aims to enable a specific person access to a specific dataset for a specific research purpose.

The Databrary Access Agreement is designed to authorize researchers to access to all shared data in the repository, thus IRB approval is not required in order to become authorized. IRB approval is a separate but parallel part of using Databrary, and is only required once a researcher intends to conduct research with Databrary data or to collect data that they plan to contribute to Databrary.

I’m happy to talk anytime if you’d like to talk through our access model or if you have any other questions about the authorization process.

Many thanks,
Lisa

# FOLLOW UP FROM MONTHS OF NO RESPONSE OF SUBMITTED AGREEMENT

Subject: Following up on your Databrary authorization

Dear Dr. [PI Last Name],

It’s been a couple months since we’ve heard from your school's Authorized Organizational Representative about your submitted authorization request for Databrary access. Were there any issues or questions that they raised that we could help with?

We’d love to help you get authorized for Databrary access. Would you like us to follow up with your SRO again? If we still don’t hear anything, a nudge from you might help get your authorization back on their radar. Please let me know if there is anything we can do to help.

Best,
Andrea

## FOLLOW UP FROM MONTHS OF NO RESPONSE FROM SCHOOL, ASKING TO SUBMIT TO NEW PERSON  (IF NEEDED)

Dear Dr. Norcia,

It’s been a very long time since we’ve heard from your school's OSR about your submitted authorization request for Databrary access. I’d love to help you get authorized for Databrary and get your agreement finalized. I'm so sorry for the long delay, it's very unusual to not hear anything at all from a school for so long. I looked into it and it seems that Kevin Vermillion, who I worked with previously and who signed the agreement for other Stanford faculty, may not be at Stanford any more and that might explain the lack of response we've been getting.

May I follow up with your OSR again? It seems like the new person to contact about your agreement may be Caroline Jones, as she is the new contract officer assigned to Psychology. You won't need to do anything, I'm happy to work directly with your university officials and keep you copied so you are in the loop on everything. I hope we can get your authorization finalized quickly, and again, apologies for the unusually long delay in getting this processed. Please let me know if there is anything we can do to help.

Best,
Lisa

# FOLLOW UP FROM NONRESPONSIVE PI

Dear [RESEARCHER],

I'm reaching out to you to see if you're still interested in gaining access to Databrary's shared resources. Please let me know if I can help with the authorization process by reaching out to your institution on your behalf. I'm also happy to answer any questions you may have.

Best,
Vicky


# IRB APPROVAL NOT NECESSARY

# DUA vs. Databrary Agreement

To provide a bit of background, this Agreement is different from a traditional DUA because there is no obligation for authorized investigators to use or to contribute data. Once our researchers are planning to share data from lab or repurpose shared data, they would seek proper IRB approval for those activities. Please let me know if you have any questions or if I can help in any way.

Best,
Andrea


# UNSURE ABOUT WHO SIGNED THE AGREEMENT- DEAN
Dear Erin,

I sent your Access Agreement out to get approved and they realized that your agreement was signed by your college's Associated Dean for Research. This may be no problem but NYU has made it clear to us that the Access Agreement must be signed by someone who has the ability to sign legally binding documents on behalf of the institution. Typically at every other institution, that has been someone in the Research Services & Administration Office or Sponsored Programs Office, which is why we originally directed the agreement to the Director, Ken Packman.

Could you please provide me a bit of background on how the agreement got signed by the Associated Dean of Research at your college? If Mr. Packman sanctioned this and the agreement is legally binding, then we can approve the agreement and your authorization. If not, we might have to go back to Mr. Packman and see if we can get someone from the Research Services & Administration Office to sign it.

I apologize for the confusion. If we do have to contact the office, I am happy to follow up with them on your behalf if you'd like help in the process.

Best,
Vicky

# STORAGE LIMITATION AND FEE


You can use Databrary to upload videos and share them with your collaborators. It’s built specifically to make upload and sharing video data as easy as possible. I understand that some of these videos may never be able to be shared openly with authorized Databrary researchers, but we hope you will consider incorporating Databrary into your consents going forward on existing and/or new protocols so that future videos may be able to be shared. We have developed a template release form and videos that show how easy it is to ask participants for their permission to share their data with other researchers.

As I mentioned before, we really want to foster open sharing and reuse of raw videos. Since there are some costs associated with providing the infrastructure and the disk space for storage, we have sort of a ‘soft’ policy that researchers not only utilize Databrary’s storage capabilities for their data but also make an effort to share at least some of their data going forward (or at least ask participants for permission to share). We don’t currently charge researchers for storage as those costs are covered by our current funding, but in the future we may need to put storage fees in place for data that is not shared with the Databrary community.

## PI REGISTERS WITH LAB EMAIL

I also noticed that registered using a lab email address. For security reasons, we prefer that each individual has their own account with their own personal email. We try to make it easy on the site to share data through different users and manage their permissions. Because of this, I'm CC'ing your personal address that I have looked up.


## PI EXPLAINING USE OF DATABRARY TO THEIR OSP

(PETER MARSHALL AT TEMPLE)

Dear Jeff,

At this point I'm not planning on uploading data from a specific project.  At this point I am just interested in seeing what is on there and how it might be useful. Look at the "Use Cases" page at https://databrary.org/about/use-cases.html I can see plenty of ways that I could utilize this service without uploading my own data.

I know Karen Adolph at NYU, who has been heavily involved in the Databrary project, and last week she posted to the Cognitive Development Society listserv about using video clips from Databrary for teaching and illustrative purposes. That is what got me started on taking a look at this site, which I had already heard about a few times.

Is it possible to grant access for now, so I can see what the site is useful for? Then I would check back with you at a later point if I become interested in adding any data from my own work.

Thanks,
Peter

#OVERWHELMED AND CONFUSED PI
Dear Nathan,
Allow me to explain:

To share identifiable data (research videos have faces, voices, names, etc!), Databrary limits access to responsible people (called “authorized researchers") at responsible institutions and we request permission to share from the participants in the videos.

You registered to become an authorized researcher on Databrary in preparation for the workshop this Friday. “Authorization” allows you full access to all of the shared data in the library. It also allows you to contribute research videos, excerpts, and metadata (with your IRB’s permission and participants’ permission). Your students and staff members cannot become authorized; this is a privilege reserved for faculty members. However, you can grant them affiliate status after you are authorized.

To become authorized on Databrary, the faculty member’s university must sign an agreement that says that the researcher is indeed a faculty member at that school, that the researcher has PI status, and that the university has an IRB that oversees ethical guidelines for human research. The researchers, in turn, sign the agreement to state that they will respect participants’ wishes about sharing, that they will treat other people’s data with the same high care they treat their own, and that they will monitor their students’ use of other people’s data as they do for their own data. These sorts of agreements are entirely normal and they are between university OSPs or grants/contracts offices. 196 universities have authorized their faculty as of today, including UMD, which has authorized 6 faculty members.

If you (or any affiliates in your lab) ever decide to contribute data or decide to use data for research purposes, you will also need the agreement of your IRB. However, you can browse Databrary, use excerpts for teaching and non-research or pre-research purposes, without dealing with your IRB.

Brian Falasca is the administrator in your office of sponsored programs who has authorized the 6 faculty members so far at UMD.

We have a description of all of this in the access guide at: https://databrary.org/access.html

Please let us know if this isn’t clear. It’s very different from the usual routine, so thank you for asking for clarification.

Best,
Karen
