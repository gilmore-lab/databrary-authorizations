## Amendment Requests

### Reply when Amendment is Requested
Subject: Request for amendment to the Databrary Access Agreement

Dear [Dr./Ms./Mr. OSP Name],

We understand your concerns. However, hundreds of public institutions across the United States (and internationally) have entered into the Databrary Access Agreement, as written. The wording in the Agreement has been designed to be purposely broad to accommodate local and state laws. We are a non-profit organization, focused on the protection of research participants' rights and privacy, and any modification to the Databrary Access Agreement has the potential to reduce those protections. We request that you execute the Agreement as it is written.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Many thanks, 
Andrea

Subject: Request for amendment to the Databrary Access Agreement

Dear [Dr./Ms./Mr. OSP Name],

The wording in the Agreement - particularly around indemnification - has been designed to be purposely broad to accommodate differences in international and state laws. We are a non-profit organization, focused on the protection of research participants' rights and privacy, and any modification to the Databrary Access Agreement has the potential to reduce those protections. We request that you execute the Agreement as it is written.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Many thanks, 
Andrea

### Amendment Rejected

Subject: Amendment Status: Databrary Access Agreement for Dr. [FULL NAME]

Dear [Dr./Ms./Mr. OSP Name],

Your institution asked to edit the indemnification clause in the agreement; however, NYU's general counsel cannot accept the edit because Databrary [REASON], we cannot make changes to the agreement on a case-by-case basis.  Please advise if we can move forward with the agreement without the proposed edits (attached).

I look forward to hearing from you.

Many thanks, 
Andrea

## Emails to PI when unsure of status

### When PI is not found on their university website

Subject: Regarding your Databrary authorization request

Dear Dr. [Last Name],

Thank you for registering on Databrary. "Authorized investigator” status requires that the researcher be a professor (or similar) at a college or university. Alternatively, researchers who work under the supervision of a professor (students, postdocs, staff) can be authorized as an “affiliate” by an authorized professor at their university. I am unable to locate your profile online to determine whether you are eligible for investigator status. Please, can you send me the link to your profile page on your university’s website? Or if you will need to become authorized as an affiliate, please ask your supervising professor to apply for authorization.

Kind regards,  
Andrea

### Email to investigator who doesn't understand how the Databrary authorization process works

Subject: Regarding your Databrary account

Dear Dr. [LAST NAME],

I am glad to hear that you are interested in using Databrary for your research. Databrary authorization must be approved by your institution. In addition, to be an Authorized Investigator on Databrary you must have:

  - PI status or be eligible to conduct independent research at your institution;
  - All current research ethics training required by your institution; and
  - An ethics or institutional review board that reviews and approves research involving human subjects.
    
If you are a post-doc, a doctoral student, or a lab staff member, you will need to request access from your supervisor or PI as an affiliate. Your supervisor or PI must register as an Authorized Investigator, if they have not already done so.

If you are eligible to become an Authorized Investigator according to the items above, can you send me the link to your profile page on your university’s website? Or if you will need to become authorized as an affiliate, please ask your supervising professor to apply for authorization.

Please let me know if you have any further questions regarding this authorization process.

Kind regards,  
Andrea

When the school is already approved
Subject: Your Databrary Authorization

Dear Dr. [Last Name],

Thank you for registering on Databrary. I received your authorization request. The next step to complete your authorization is to send your Access Agreement to your university for their approval. The agreement needs to be approved by your office of sponsored programs—once they've co-signed your agreement, your authorization will be effective. By signing the agreement, the university agrees that they will take responsibility for your use of Databrary resources. They verify that you are an independent researcher and that the university has an IRB that oversees your research activities.

To save researchers time and annoyance, with each school I have generally been submitting agreements to the university on behalf of the researcher requesting authorization. At **[YOUR INSTITUTION], [AUTHORIZING OFFICIAL]** previously approved agreements for other faculty and was very helpful in the authorization process.

Can I have your permission to reach out to **[AUTHORIZING OFFICIAL] on your behalf (I will of course keep you in the loop on all correspondence)?

Many thanks,
