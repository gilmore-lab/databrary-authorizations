### When Writing to a new AOR 

Subject: Following up on Dr. [FULL NAME]'s Databrary Access Agreement

Dear Ms. [Last Name],

I write on behalf of Dr. **[PI Full Name]** who has requested access to Databrary, a web-based library for sharing video data in developmental science. I have tried to reach **[Previous OSP Name]** multiple times over the past couple months but **[without answer/multiple out of office notes]**. Please see the correspondence below. I believe that she is the appropriate person to discuss the request with but I am hoping that you can help us either get her attention or help process the request. It has been a few months and I would like to move forward so Dr. [PI Last Name] can utilize Databrary's resources.

For background, access is granted only to authorized individuals. To become authorized, 1) the user must read and understand the Databrary Access Agreement and, 2) an authorized organizational representative of the university or institution must co-sign his or her agreement. By signing, the institution verifies that the individual is eligible to conduct independent research and maintains an ethics board that oversees research activities. IRB approval is not required for authorization to access the library.

You can find more information about Databrary on our website (databrary.org). We also have a document addressing the most commonly asked questions by institutions: http://databrary.org/access/guide/institutions.html.

Many thanks,

## Amendment Requests

### Reply when Amendment is Requested
Subject: Request for amendment to the Databrary Access Agreement

Dear [Dr./Ms./Mr. OSP Name],

We understand your concerns. However, hundreds of public institutions across the United States (and internationally) have entered into the Databrary Access Agreement, as written. The wording in the Agreement has been designed to be purposely broad to accommodate local and state laws. We are a non-profit organization, focused on the protection of research participants' rights and privacy, and any modification to the Databrary Access Agreement has the potential to reduce those protections. We request that you execute the Agreement as it is written.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Many thanks, 
Andrea

### Reply when removal of indemnification is requested

Subject: Request for amendment to the Databrary Access Agreement

Dear [Dr./Ms./Mr. OSP Name],

We understand your concerns. However, hundreds of public institutions across the United States (and internationally) have entered into the Databrary Access Agreement, as written. The wording in the Agreement - particularly around indemnification - has been designed to be purposely broad to accommodate differences in international and state laws. We are a non-profit organization, focused on the protection of research participants' rights and privacy, and any modification to the Databrary Access Agreement has the potential to reduce those protections. We request that you execute the Agreement as it is written.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Many thanks, 
Andrea

### Amendment Rejected

Subject: Amendment Status: Databrary Access Agreement for Dr. [FULL NAME]

Dear [Dr./Ms./Mr. OSP Name],

Your institution asked to edit the indemnification clause in the agreement; however, NYU's general counsel cannot accept the edit because Databrary [REASON], we cannot make changes to the agreement on a case-by-case basis.  Please advise if we can move forward with the agreement without the proposed edits (attached).

I look forward to hearing from you.

Many thanks, 
Andrea
