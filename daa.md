This is the page that should change to the below information: https://www.databrary.org/resources/agreement.html


The full Databrary Access Agreement was modified on 4/29/2020, to separate and reorganize the associated documents into the Databrary Access Agreement, Statement of Rights and Responsibilities (Annex I), Additional Authorized Investigators (Annex II), and Databrary Access Guide (Annex III). Language regarding Databrary and GDPR was added, and these documents contain information that was previously only found on the Databrary website.

The Databrary Access Agreement [.pdf] [.doc] will get signed for all institutions even if they have signed an old version of the agreement and were accustomed to only signing Annex II for additional investigators. Once the new Databrary Access Agreement has been signed once, Annex II may be used.

Annex I: Statement of Rights and Responsibilities [.pdf] [.doc] is signed each time the full Databrary Access Agreement above is signed.

Annex II: Additional Authorized Investigators [.pdf] [.doc] is signed to add additional Authorized Investigators only AFTER an institution, even a previously approved institution, has completed a new Full Databrary Access Agreement. An institution always has the option to sign the full Databrary Access Agreement and Annex I to add additional Authorized Investigators.

Annex III: Databrary Access Guide [.pdf] [.doc] is not required to be signed. This document provides information useful for Institutions and Authorized Investigators who wish to use Databrary's services.

At this time Agreements are being sent to Investigators and Authorized Organizational Representatives (AORs) via DocuSign from the Databrary Authorizations Specialist. Investigators will sign first, then the AOR will recieve the electronic document to sign.
