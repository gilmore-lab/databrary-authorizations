There are multiple tabs on the left side of the screen that need to be completed to set up a new volume. These tabs need to be completed in order.

Create the Volume Overview by choosing if the volume is related to a published resource and answering the related questions (Title, Description, Internal Short Name and additional citation information if necessary). When all items are entered, select 'Save'

Next, go to the Manage Access Tab. In this tab, you can choose volume sharing options and add collaborators (faculty, staff, students) that already have an account on Databrary. Click 'Save' when done.

Please note: Only an Authorized Investigator can 'Share Entire Volume'

Next, choose the 'Enter Data' tab. You may do this by uploading an appropriately formatted .csv file or entering these data individually. To do this individually, click in the 'ID' box to add a participant. After the line in the spreadsheet is created for a participant, related files may then be added.
