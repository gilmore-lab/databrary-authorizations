Decide if you are entitled to Authorized Investigator status, or are requesting affiliate status from your PI (See info section, below, for more information on who qualifies as an Authorized Investigator.)



To register as an Authorized Investigator:

Select the Authorized Investigator radio button and search for your institution.
This will auto-generate a notification to the Databrary team with a Databrary Access Agreement, which needs to be signed both by you and your contracts office.
Databrary's authorization team will be in touch within 24-48 hours to help you through the process.
There is more general information about becoming an Authorized Investigator on Databrary here and here.

To register as an Affiliate:

Select the Affiliate radio button and search for your sponsoring PI's name. (Note: If your PI does not yet have an account on Databrary, he or she will have to follow the instructions above to become an Authorized Investigator.)
Your PI will receive a notification that you have applied for access, and can approve you. Alternately, your PI can go to their profile, and add you as an affiliate manually.
