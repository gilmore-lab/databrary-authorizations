*ATTACH THE AGREEMENT WITH HIS NAME ON IT*

* OPEN PROJECT: CHANGE TO SUBMITTED

# FIRST EMAIL RESPONSE TO REVISION REQUEST

Dear [OSP PERSON],

Thank you for your email response. NYU provides Databrary as a non-profit service to the developmental science research community.  We have worked to craft the Databrary Access Agreement to allow NYU to operate the service in a manner that also benefits the community. The Access Agreement is our standard and it is not our practice to make changes to it unless the signing institution is forbidden by law to agree to its terms.  If your proposal concerns such a provision, please describe the issue to us in your response.  If it concerns another issue, we can discuss the matter but may not be able to accommodate the change.

Best,
Vicky


# INTRO FOR REVISED AGREEMENT

Note, we've revised our agreement since Vanderbilt approved our previous version of the agreement for Dr. Amy Needham's authorization. The terms are essentially the same, but we have tried to address the most common questions and issues that arose--such as that IRB approval is not required by Databrary to become authorized, as well as the language around the disclaimer which I know raised some questions on your end the last time around. Please let me know if there are any questions about the new agreement.

# FOLLOW UP EMAIL WHEN NO RESPONSE FROM OSP
*ATTACH AGREEMENT AGAIN*

Subject: Following up on Dr. [FULL NAME]'s Databrary Access Agreement

Dear [AUTHORIZING OFFICIAL],

​Can you offer any update​s ​regarding Dr. **[RESEARCHER FULL NAME]**’s authorization request for Databrary access through **[INSTITUTION]**? We would like to get Dr. **[RESEARCHER LAST NAME]** authorized as soon as possible so **[she/he]** may access Databrary's shared resources and data. Please let me know if I can provide any assistance or if there is another person whom I should work with on this agreement.

Best regards,  
Andrea

# FOLLOW UP EMAIL WHEN WRITING TO NEW OSP OFFICIAL

Dear Ms. Freed,

I write on behalf of Dr. David Cross who has requested access to Databrary, a web-based library for sharing video data in developmental science. I have tried to reach Ms. Bonnie Melhart multiple times over the past few months without answer. Please see the correspondence below. I believe that she is the appropriate person to discuss the request with but I am hoping that you can help us either get her attention or help process the request. It has been a few months and I would like to move forward so Dr. Cross can utilize Databrary's resources.

For background, access is granted only to authorized individuals. To become authorized, 1) the user must read and understand the Databrary Access Agreement and, 2) an authorized organizational representative of the university or institution must co-sign his or her agreement. By signing, the institution verifies that the individual is eligible to conduct independent research and maintains an ethics board that oversees research activities. IRB approval is not required for authorization to access the library.

You can find more information about Databrary on our website (databrary.org). We also have a document addressing the most commonly asked questions by institutions: http://databrary.org/access/guide/institutions.html. The other institutions that have approved and signed the agreement are also listed on our website: http://databrary.org/community/institutions.html.

Attached is the e-signed agreement for your review. If you approve, kindly return the signed copy to me to complete Dr. Cross' authorization. Please let me know if you have any questions or need any further information.

Many thanks,
Vicky


#INSTITUTION SUBMITS REVISIONS TO AGREEMENT

## Accepting some changes but pushing back for other unnecessary changes

Dear Caroline,

Thank you for your response. We have looked over the proposed revisions and we would like to discuss them.

Our intention was to make the institution the only legally binding entity so we accepted the changes to take out "Authorized Investigator" in the places you listed. We are planning to make similar edits to the master agreement. I have attached an updated agreement with those approved changes.

However, this is a standard form agreement and it is not our practice to accept changes to the master agreement unless required by state or local policy. Is there a specific reason why you need to add the last clause: "when found so by a court of competent jurisdiction"? If you agree to leaving out this clause, we can generate a final copy for signing and we can approve Dr. Mulvey's authorization with your signature. Otherwise, we will have to go to general counsel to review the proposed revision. Please let me know how you would like to move forward.

Best,
Vicky

## HEADING OFF LINE EDITS
Dear [OSP PERSON],

Thank you for your email response. NYU provides Databrary as a valuable research service for the developmental science community at no cost and operating within a non-profit research institution; these provisions allow it to do so with an appropriate level of risk. We have worked to craft the Databrary Access Agreement to allow NYU to operate the service in a manner that also benefits the community. The Access Agreement is our standard and it is not our practice to make changes to it unless the signing institution is forbidden by law to agree to its terms.  If your proposal concerns such a provision, please describe the issue to us in your response.  If it concerns another issue, we can discuss the matter but may not be able to accommodate the change.

Best,
Vicky

Dear Gina,

Thank you for your response. We previously received a signed agreement from the University of California, Davis without any revision changes for Dr. Lisa Oakes (attached below). This is a standard form agreement and we don't allow changes to it unless the signing institution is forbidden under the law from agreeing to its terms. We also only use a single standard agreement for each institution and its faculty.

Please let me know if you can accept the agreement as is. I look forward to hearing from you.

Best,
Vicky

# IRB APPROVAL NOT NECESSARY
Hi Alex,

I understand and thanks for reaching out with this question. There is human subjects data in Databrary but that does not mean human subjects research is occurring because a researcher is requesting access.

On our end, the Databrary Access Agreement allows for the university to vouch for the faculty member and take responsibility for their use of Databrary data. The responsibility is on the authorized researcher (or the requestor) to seek the necessary approvals if they seek to do HS research with data from Databrary. Largely at the urging of our federal funders, we've set up Databrary to enable many use cases that don't constitute human subjects research. They would be governed by the same agreement but it would be their responsibility to submit an IRB application for their project. We don't require people notify Databrary if they are beginning human subjects research with the data.

We've worked closely with federal officials, and legal and research ethics experts to create a framework that allows researchers to share and reuse the data in Databrary in a secure and protected way that can also speed the pace of discovery. So, largely the system is based on researchers fulfilling their responsibilities (which are set out in the Access Agreement). I hope that is helpful in answering your question about how this is handled administratively from our side. Please let me know if you have any further questions or would like to talk through it in more detail.

Many thanks,
Lisa

# NOT A DATA USE AGREEMENT

Unfortunately, some schools have interpreted our Access Agreement to be a more traditional Data Use Agreement which is not quite correct, and is why they are asking for IRB approval and consent information. Our agreement is different from a DUA because it grants contributor and access privileges to all shared data on Databrary. There is no obligation for authorized investigators to use or to contribute data. (DUAs, on the other hand, allow for the transfer of a specific dataset for a discrete research project, which is why they almost always require IRB approval to accompany the agreement.)

I might suggest communicating that you are seeking authorization only to browse all the shared data, not to share your own data or conduct research using Databrary data to see if your Office of Research will process the agreement accordingly. Once you are planning to share data from your lab or repurpose shared data, you would seek IRB approval for those activities. Just to be clear for the question about consents, all shared Databrary data are collected under informed consent and explicit informed consent for sharing through Databrary.

Of course, if it helps for me to communicate with your research office directly, I would be happy to do that. I hope we can find a way forward with your university and that we can get you authorized.

Dear Ms. Webb,

I apologize if the Agreement did not get to the correct office. I tried to contact Mr. Brian Herman twice without response. I've attached the agreement below and can also forward it on behalf of Dr. Yonas to the SPA office if that would be helpful. Please let me know which contact in that office is appropriate as I do not see a general email on the site.

To touch on the request that it is routed as an MTARF authorization form, Databrary's Agreement is different from a DUA because it grants contributor and access privileges to all shared data on Databrary. There is no obligation for authorized investigators to use or to contribute data.

Dr. Yonas can correct me if I'm wrong but I believe that he is seeking authorization only to browse all the shared data, not to share his own data or conduct research using Databrary data. Once he plans to share data from his lab or repurpose shared data, he would seek IRB approval for those activities.

Please let me know if there are any questions.

Best,
Vicky
